# AutoSprite

Generate even tilesheets from non-equally spaced tilesheets



## TODO

Allow for multiple grids in same picture (for different sized sprites)
- would require increments of 8 or something
- probably not helpful since could re-order sprites too much. Better to let the user just pick/edit shots to just have similiar sized sprites

Properly size output images
